# CS290

Here we can add our files and push changes so whoever compiles the website has a place to make sure they're getting the newest version of each file.

HOW TO USE GITHUB:
You will either be pushing(sending) your files/edits to the GitHub server,
or pulling(download)the files from the Github server into your local storage.

* Don't include single quotes in your actual commands,
  I use them here to enclose what commands should look like

* All of this should be done in git bash or git shell
  within the GitHub/CS290 folder

	HOW TO PUSH:
		1. Create, edit, or delete a file

		2. type 'git add filename'
			- This adds the file to the staging area
			- You can type 'git add .' to add all changes instead

		3. type 'git commit -m "Short message describing the commit"'
			- This packages all adds into one edit
			- The messages are super helpful!!!

		4. type 'git push origin master'
			- This pushes your commits on the master branch
			  to the origin, which is the GitHub server
			- You can just type 'git push' if we decide not
			  to use multiple branches

		5. type 'git status' (not necessary, just helpful)
			- This displays a status of your files
			  for clarification as to what is going on

	HOW TO PULL:
		1. type 'git pull origin master'
			- This pulls the latest files from the origin's
			  master branch and merges them with your local files
			- Again, 'git pull' works if we're just using one branch
