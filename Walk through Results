Starting at landing page
 --> with no explanation go to login
 --> after login go to blank screen
 **need to have an actual landing page which doesn't take us directly to a user profile
 **should have the option of signing in or creating account; both will take you through
  CAS login but the create account should drop you on the create profile page while the
  signing in should take you to a user dashboard
  &&&&& Happy path completed for the following flow &&&&&
  Flow should be as follows:
  
    Arrive at landing page
      Select create account
        Login with OSU account -->Delay going to page with warning of what is going on or put in sign in box
          Successful Login redirects to create profile (have)
            Profile gets successfully POSTED to db and information (have) 
            **User is taken to a dashboard with an explanation with what they can do --> Dashboard should include menu system: 
            post house (have), find house, find roommate -->Should also include saved houses/roommates
          Unsuccessful Login redirects to fail page
      Select sign in 
        Successful Login redirects to user dashboard
        Unsuccessful Login redirects to fail page

Clicking "Home" doesn't take you anywhere --> this should be realloacted to either not exist or redirect to user dashboard
Clicking "Search" doesn't take you anywhere --> should change this menu system to be on the dashboard so that we can control 
differences between roommate search and housing search
Clicking "Results" takes us to the results of querying the housing database but this needs to change
  Find housing should take you to the current results page but only with information which matches the user's parameters.
  Essentially, we can have them fill out and advanced search and them grab all of the relevant entries in our database.
  **Need to write an advanced search for housing, need to query the database correctly (adjust the code we already have),
  **Need to add longitude and latitude per address in the database --> believe this can be done in Google API?
  Find roommate should due something similar but without a map --> user photos instead? Need to get picture upload working
  Need to make all results clickable so they will take you to our template housing/roommate forms.
  
Logout doesn't actually log you out --> needs to be fixed
